# MusicManagerWebApp
WebApp version of the MusicManager app

More fully featured version of MusicManager, with added bonus of a webapp front end on top.  Nowhere near ready yet, and is pretty rudimentary in styling, but it's getting there.

Main aim is to be able to fully enrich the library from the webapp.
